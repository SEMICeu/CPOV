# Core Public Organisation Vocabulary (CPOV)

This is the issue tracker for the maintenance of the Core Public Organisation Vocabulary.

The Core Public Organisation Vocabulary (CPOV) is designed to support the exchange of basic information about individual public organisations. It aspires to become a common data model for describing public organisations in the European Union.

The current version of the Core Public Organisation Vocabulary can be downloaded from https://semiceu.github.io/CPOV/releases/2.1.0/.

Public organisations involve elected representatives but these descriptions are out of scope but may be the focus of future work once the vocabulary is established and used. The vocabulary is not concerned with features associated with commercial entities such as shareholdings and ownership.

The Core Public Organisation Vocabulary is designed to describe the organisation itself. Whilst the vocabulary may support links to descriptions of public services, members of staff or other resources such as relevant legislation, policies and jurisdictional coverage, it will not describe those resources in detail. 

This specification was produced by the Core Vocabularies Working Group (Person Task Force), following the Process and Methodology for Developing Core Vocabularies, https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/semantic-interoperability-community-semic/document/process-and-methodology-developing-core-vocabularies. It has been reviewed by representatives of the Member States of the European Union, PSI publishers, and by other interested parties. On 23 May 2012, the Member State representatives in the ISA Coordination Group have endorsed the Core Public Organisation vocabulary v1.00, acknowledging the work and promising to further disseminate it at national level. 

Any problems encountered, or suggestions for new functionalities can be submitted as issues on the Core Public Organisation Vocabulary repository on GitHub. A short guideline for submitting issues can be found at https://github.com/SEMICeu/CPOV/wiki.
